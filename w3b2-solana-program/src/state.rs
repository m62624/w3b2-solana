//! # State & Account Structs
//!
//! This module defines the core data structures used by the on-chain program.
//! It includes:
//!
//! 1.  **Account Data Structs (`AdminProfile`, `UserProfile`):** These define the shape of the
//!     on-chain data stored in Program-Derived Address (PDA) accounts. They represent the
//!     state of service providers and their users.
//!
//! 2.  **Instruction Accounts Structs (e.g., `AdminRegisterProfile`):** These are `#[derive(Accounts)]`
//!     structs that define the set of accounts required by each on-chain instruction. They
//!     enforce security constraints, such as ensuring signers are authorized and that PDAs
//!     are derived correctly.
