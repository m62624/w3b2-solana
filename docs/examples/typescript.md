# Example: TypeScript Client

This document will provide an example of a TypeScript client for a web application interacting with the gRPC gateway. It will demonstrate how to:
- Use a generated gRPC-web client.
- Interact with a browser wallet like Phantom to get the user's public key and request signatures.
- Decode the unsigned transaction from the gateway, sign it, and submit it.
