/*
    This file defines serializable data structures intended for off-chain communication protocols.
    The on-chain program itself does not interpret the content of the `payload` in the `dispatch`
    instructions; it treats it as an opaque byte array (`Vec<u8>`).

    This design pattern effectively turns the Solana blockchain into a secure, decentralized, and
    auditable message bus. Off-chain components (like the `w3b2-connector`) are responsible
    for serializing these structs into the `payload` and deserializing them from the corresponding
    on-chain events. This keeps the on-chain logic minimal and gas-efficient while enabling
    arbitrarily complex off-chain protocols.
