# W3B2 Bridge Connector (`w3b2-solana-connector`)

This crate is a high-level, asynchronous Rust library for building backend services that interact with the `w3b2-solana-program`. It provides a non-custodial `TransactionBuilder` and a resilient `EventManager` for listening to on-chain events.

It is the ideal choice for building a custom Rust-native backend if the `w3b2-solana-gateway` does not fit your needs.
