# Solana Connector (`w3b2-solana-connector`)

This crate is a high-level, asynchronous Rust library for building backend services that interact with the `w3b2-solana-program`. It provides a `TransactionBuilder` for creating unsigned transactions and an `EventManager` for listening to on-chain events.

It is designed for building custom Rust backends that require direct interaction with the on-chain program.

## Documentation

For detailed information on the `TransactionBuilder` and `EventManager`, see the main documentation site.
